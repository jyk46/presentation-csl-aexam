Title:
Exploiting Amorphous Data Parallelism with the Explicit-Parallel-Call Architecture

Abstract:
Heterogeneous architectures combining general-purpose multicores and
data-parallel accelerators have become an increasingly common approach to
addressing serious technology challenges. Unfortunately, there are still
significant inefficiencies with this approach largely due to the
different abstractions used to expose parallelism across different
microarchitectures, including incongruity between programming models and
compilers, as well as suboptimal load balancing. We propose a novel
explicit-parallel-call (XPC) architecture which exploits a ubiquitous
type of parallelism called amorphous data parallelism exposed as parallel
function calls to unify various microarchitectural tiles under a single
software framework. In terms of hardware, we plan to explore three
different XPC tiles: tightly coupled lanes where function calls are
executed in lock-step, loosely coupled lanes where function calls are
executed using dynamic load balancing, and cooperative multicore where
function calls are mapped across traditional in-order cores. In terms of
software, we plan to develop a highly productive parallel programming
framework for generically encoding amorphous data parallelism, in
addition to runtimes for adaptively scheduling work across the XPC tiles.
